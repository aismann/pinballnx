# PinballNX
A homebrew pinball game for the nintendo switch. Currently a work in progress. 

Made with [libcross2d](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/libcross2d), [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D), and [earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp).

These libraries have their own licenses which permit my use of them. Their licenses are preserved and their programs are appreciated.
